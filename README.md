Likewise, it displays India's states and districts' covid-19 dashboard. It also contains a vaccine slot finder application which allows the user to check the availability of vaccines in his/her locality. It keeps users updated with daily covid-19 pandemic news.

# Motivation for the project

Many people in the world are losing their life due to misinformation and lack of knowledge. I believe this website will guide people on how to deal with this pandemic and how to help others. They can easily get all the latest information regarding covid-19 from this website. It also helps them for booking their vaccination slot.

## How our 7 Days of Web Development helped you in making this project?

The 7 days of web development codeathon enhances my HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT knowledge. It makes me more familiar with APIs and different CSS frameworks. It helps me in making my code both qualitative and less quantitative.
